# ReEngage Voices — Platform Plan

A separate Lovable project, reusing the marketing site's visual language (warm earthy palette, serif headings, waveform player, mini player, scallop dividers) but rebuilt as a real audio app. Spotify shell with archive depth: a player that follows you everywhere, fast filtered browsing across every dimension, and rich pages for elders, regions, tribes, and themes — with transcripts and provenance underneath each story.

## 1. Information architecture

```
/                       Home (editorial + Recently added + For you)
/browse                 All stories, faceted filters (region, tribe, language, type, mood, duration)
/search?q=              Global search (stories, elders, regions, tribes, collections)
/stories/:id            Story page: player, transcript, translation, elder card, related
/elders                 Elders directory
/elders/:slug           Elder profile: bio, photo, all stories, regions/tribes/languages
/regions/:slug          Region page (country/region/village hierarchy)
/tribes/:slug           Tribe / ethnic-group page
/languages/:slug        Language page
/themes/:slug           Theme/type page (folktales, songs, proverbs, history, ritual, lived memory)
/collections            Curated playlists (editorial + user)
/collections/:slug
/library                Signed-in: Saved, Playlists, History, Following (elders)
/contribute             Agadi WhatsApp explainer + in-browser recorder
/contribute/record      Authed recorder + metadata form
/auth                   Sign in / Sign up (optional)
/account                Profile, language preference, notifications
```

## 2. Layout (Spotify shell)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Persistent player: cover · title/elder · waveform · ⏯  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Collapsible sidebar (shadcn Sidebar, icon-collapse on mobile/tablet).
- Persistent bottom player powered by the same `AudioProvider` pattern as the marketing site, but **without** the 10-second preview limit and **without** the upsell dialog. Full waveform, scrub, prev/next from queue, shuffle, repeat-one, volume.
- Floating WhatsApp "Share your story" button stays, linking to Agadi.

## 3. Core features

### Browse & filtering
- `/browse` shows a grid of story cards with a sticky filter rail:
  - **Region** (country → region → village, hierarchical multiselect)
  - **Tribe / ethnic group** (multiselect, searchable)
  - **Language** (multiselect)
  - **Story type** (folktale, song, proverb, history, ritual, lived memory, lullaby…)
  - **Mood** (joyful, mournful, instructive, sacred, playful)
  - **Duration** (<3m, 3–10m, 10m+)
  - **Sort** (newest, oldest, most played, longest, shortest)
- Filters reflect in URL query params (shareable).
- Empty state per facet ("No stories yet in this tribe — be the first to contribute").

### Story page
- Hero with cover, title, elder name, region, tribe, language, duration, play count.
- Big play button → loads into persistent player + queues "related stories".
- Waveform with chapter markers (if provided).
- Transcript pane (original language) + tab for English translation when available.
- Elder mini-card linking to `/elders/:slug`.
- Tags (region/tribe/language/type/mood) all linkable to their pages.
- Related stories rail ("More from this elder", "More Yorùbá folktales", "More from Ife").
- Save, add-to-playlist, share, download-transcript actions.

### Elder profile
- Portrait, name, region, tribe, languages spoken, short bio.
- All stories listed with mini-players.
- "Follow" (signed-in) so new recordings notify follower.

### Library (signed-in)
- Saved stories, Playlists (CRUD), Listening history, Followed elders.

### Search
- Single search across stories, elders, regions, tribes, languages, collections, transcript text.
- Recent + suggested queries.

### Contribute (Agadi + web recorder)
- `/contribute` explains Agadi with a prominent WhatsApp CTA.
- `/contribute/record` (signed-in): record in browser (Web Audio → WAV), enter metadata (elder name, region, tribe, language, story type, mood, optional transcript), submit for moderation.
- Submissions land in a `pending_stories` table; admins approve before publishing.

### Player extras
- Queue panel (slide-over) with reorder + clear.
- "Listening as a journey" mode: continuous playback through a tribe/region/theme.
- Sleep timer (nice-to-have).

## 4. Data model (Lovable Cloud)

```text
profiles(id pk → auth.users, display_name, avatar_url, preferred_language, created_at)
user_roles(user_id, role enum[admin|moderator|user])

regions(id, slug, country, region, village, parent_id nullable)
tribes(id, slug, name, description)
languages(id, slug, name, iso_code)
themes(id, slug, name, kind enum[type|mood])  -- folktale, song, joyful, …

elders(id, slug, name, bio, photo_url, region_id, tribe_id, primary_language_id)
elder_languages(elder_id, language_id)

stories(
  id, slug, title, description,
  elder_id, region_id, tribe_id, language_id,
  audio_url, duration_seconds, cover_url,
  transcript_original, transcript_english,
  play_count, status enum[draft|pending|published], published_at, created_by
)
story_themes(story_id, theme_id)

collections(id, slug, title, description, cover_url, curator_id, is_public)
collection_items(collection_id, story_id, position)

saves(user_id, story_id, created_at)            -- "liked"
follows(user_id, elder_id, created_at)
play_history(user_id, story_id, played_at, ms_listened)

pending_stories(id, submitter_id, payload jsonb, audio_url, status, reviewed_by, reviewed_at)
```

- RLS: published stories readable by `anon` + `authenticated`; writes restricted to owner or `has_role(auth.uid(),'moderator')`.
- Storage buckets: `story-audio` (public read), `story-covers` (public), `elder-portraits` (public), `pending-audio` (private).
- `user_roles` + `has_role()` security-definer function exactly as the platform's role pattern requires.

## 5. Tech stack & libraries

- Vite + React + TS + Tailwind, shadcn/ui (already standard).
- shadcn `Sidebar`, `Sheet`, `Dialog`, `Command` (search), `Tabs`, `Accordion`.
- React Router (routes above).
- TanStack Query for data fetching, server-driven filter URL state.
- Lovable Cloud for DB, auth (email/password + Google), storage, edge functions (moderation, play-count increment, search RPC).
- Reuse `Waveform`, `useAudioPlayer` (strip the 10s cap), `StoryCard` styles, design tokens, fonts.

## 6. Visual language

Carry over verbatim from marketing site:
- Warm cream background, ochre/terracotta `--primary`, `--accent`, `bg-gradient-warm`, `shadow-warm`, `grain` texture, scallop divider.
- Serif headings (existing pairing), same body sans.
- Reengage logo in sidebar + top bar.
- Floating WhatsApp button bottom-left.

Departures from marketing site:
- Dark persistent player bar (`bg-night`) at the bottom of every page.
- Denser card grids (`gap-4`, smaller covers) for browse-style scanning.
- Sidebar uses the cream tone, not dark.

## 7. Phasing

1. Shell: sidebar, top bar, routing, persistent player, home with seeded data.
2. Browse + filters + story page + elder page (read-only, public).
3. Auth + Library (saves, playlists, follows, history).
4. Contribute: Agadi page + in-browser recorder + moderation queue.
5. Search (RPC) + Collections + polish (queue panel, journey mode).
